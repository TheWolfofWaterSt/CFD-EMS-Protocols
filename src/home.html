      <p class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-8">This is the upated protocols. This Version is State Approved Protocols. The approved date is 04/30/2017. If there is a discrepancy or an error with this application please email the administrator at cvemsprotocols@gmail.com    
      <p>The above protocols are intended to be electively adopted by Chippewa Valley Regional EMS agencies who receive education, training and/or off-line medical control from common medical direction affiliated with and cooperatively facilitated by Sacred Heart Hospital, Eau Claire, WI.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="font-bold">EMS responders operating under these protocols with agency approval may provide medical care <u>only to their specific scope of practice, training and license levels.</u></b></p>
      <p>This full set of protocols is provided to all participating EMS agencies and provider levels with the intent that lower level EMS responders may know what care and interventions might be possible by obtaining intercepts from a higher level service.</p>
      <p>EMS protocols are guidelines intended to provide appropriate care to the vast majority of the ill and injured patients treated by EMS. There may be times when protocol deviation may be in the patient's best interest. EMS personnel should make a concerted effort, if safe and feasible, to discuss the case with on-line medical control prior to deviating from these established and approved protocols. Any deviation, however slight, MUST be well documented in the patient care report explaining what was done and why the deviation was felt to be appropriate.</p>
